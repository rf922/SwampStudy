# SwampStudy Repository
This repository store the contents of the swampstudy web application I created alongside a team of developers while attending San Francisco State University for CSC-648 Software Engineering. The premise behind swampstudy was to create a platform toward the intent of connecting new and continuing university students via a matching feature along with an open forum which allowed users to post and respond to questions made on a thread corresponding to a class and its department. The application is built upon a MERN stack which uses MySQL for the relational database, express, react and node. The backend architecture for said applicatio implements an N-tiered approach toward the familiar modell-view-controller architecture commonly used with MERN stack applications coupled with dependency injection via a DIContainer which manages and centralizes instantiation of resources with their associated dependencies.
