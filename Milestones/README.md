# Milestones Folder

## This folder was used to store all the necessary documents for each milestone. Each milestone folder (with the only exception of milestone5 folder) will contain two milestone documents plus their prototypes (if any). The first version of each milestone was the original submission (version 1). An additional document (version 2) is present carrying revisions suggested by the course instructor given for that specific milestone.
