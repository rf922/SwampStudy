    <p> Hello, my name is Conrad Choi and I am a Senior of SFSU and I am the GitHub Master.
         My Major is Computer Science and my career goal is to be a Cybersecurity Forensic Analyst.
          To start my journey, I always loved disassembling things as a kid, when I built my first computer I knew 
          I had to be something tech related. I am an introverted person and always dreaded group study work 
          this application will not only help those who are extrovert to find more study groups,
           but hopefully help those like me find a group of their own. </p>
