    paragraph: ` Hello everyone, I am Rafael Fabiani. I'm currently a junior
         at San Francisco State University, and I major in mathematics alongside computer science. 
         I was originally drawn to mathematics because of the influence of Professor Ni Peterkofsky. 
         Her lectures in mathematics inspired me to want to learn more about mathematics, to the point where 
         I started dedicating free time towards the study of problems which, at the time, seemed far advanced
          from the simple computations I had begun to enjoy. I would daydream about being able to write proofs 
          and study modern algebra. As time went on, with every lecture, I found myself getting more enthusiastic
           about learning for its own sake. Professor Peterkofsky's courses were challenging, and she always 
           pushed us, as her students, to strive towards excellence in everything we did, even outside of the 
           classroom. Outside of lecture, the times I got to speak with her resonated deeply with me and would
            lead me to pursue and eventually study topics in mathematics which, at that time, were far beyond
             what I had been working on, or ever thought I'd be capable of doing. There are few people in our
              lives who leave a meaningful impression upon us that persists even years later, but to this day,
               Ni Peterkofsky is one of my all-time heroes, and the reason I speak of her here is because that
                impression she left on me, I credit with partly shaping who I am today.
        What drew me originally to computer science was the love for all things technology I had growing up. I
         loved using computers, and seeing my uncles and cousins configure their modems and routers at the time
          filled me with a deep curiosity, and I wanted to be able to do those things for myself. It started as
           me tinkering with tech, taking apart laptops and rebuilding them, upgrading components, and dabbling
            with different operating systems. Eventually, I'd walk into my first computer science course, and 
            ever since, programming has felt to me more than mere coursework; it spurs me to want to learn more.
             This would bring me to San Francisco State, and where I am now: I am the backend lead for team one,
              and one of the most exciting things I look forward to this semester is working alongside Lennart,
               Conrad, Julio, and Edmund. I see them as equally passionate as I am, and seeing and hearing about 
               their experiences in computer science motivates me to want to work harder so that I can stand by
                them as a developer. I see in each of them a drive for learning, not for the sake of a grade or
                 purely to pass a course, but because this is our profession. We code and create beautiful 
                 programs, not because we are assigned to do so, but because this is something we are passionate
                  about; something which drives us. We chose to take this course, knowing it would be
                   challenging, not just because we had to, but because we were driven to face the growing 
                   challenges and obstacles that come our way because we dare to pursue our dreams. Computer
                    science, for each of us, is more than just a phase or a hobby; it is us striving to realize
                     the potential that lies within us.
    Outside of I enjoy reading, meditating and listening to music. I also really like debian and one day
     would like to be a system administrator. Here is one of my all time favorite quotes by John F Kennedy
      which he gave in his speech at Rice University  : ". We choose to go to the moon in this decade and 
      do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will
       serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one 
       that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win" `,

        I am a senior in the San Francisco State University's Undergraduate Computer Science program.
        I am excited to work with others in this class and learn how to design and create software.
        I fell in love with computer hardware. I developed an interest when I was in middle school 
        figuring out how to maximize performance for playing games. I've since built multiple computers
        for my friends and siblings. I feel joy and pride when I successfully troubleshoot why computer hardware
        is not functioning correctly. I think I've built a good knowledge base for troubleshooting. I love all
        sorts of computer hardware. From how fast CPUs, GPUs, and storage can be, to how innovative new products can be.
