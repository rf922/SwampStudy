        My Major is Computer Science and my career goal is to be a Cybersecurity Forensic Analyst.
         To start my journey, I always loved disassembling things as a kid, when I built my first computer I knew 
         I had to be something tech related. I am an introverted person and always dreaded group study work 
         this application will not only help those who are extrovert to find more study groups,
          but hopefully help those like me find a group of their own.`,
